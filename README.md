# Word-Guess-Game

For this project, I've created a Hangman style game where each of the words reference a Final Fantasy character or game staple
such as spells or items. The game prompts the user to enter a letter (and a letter only lest the user gets a message yelling at them) to guess the word. If all the blanks are filled within the 15 guess limit, the user gets a point and and the next word immdiately pops up. Each word has a picture above it to give a clue to what the word is. Once all the available words are attempted (currently 9), the game is over.


The Javascript file (found in assets/javascript folder) is very limited on functions. Anyone who wishes to work with this project (namely me) can attempt to create functions to clean up the code a bit.
